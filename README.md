# DaX macropad
The DaX Macropad, fully programmable with QMK support!
![DaX Macropad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Verbosi7y/DaX-macropad/master/DaXMacropad.jpg)

This macropad uses the Pro Micro/Elite-C microcontroller to function.
In addition, it uses the 1N4148 through hole diodes and supports MX styled switches only.

**WARNING!**
This does not support any Max-Mill Sockets so unfortunately, it is not hotswappable.

Overall, this is my very first macropad that I made from scratched with the help of open sourced
libraries and designs which has been extremely helpful while learning how to build most of what I
needed.
